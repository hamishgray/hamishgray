  <p class="text--lg">I was approached by Ecast to work with them in creating a new brand to portray them as a modern, exciting company leading the way into the future. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">I identified that their current market was over populated with companies using their cheap prices as their main selling point. This was not the correct place for Ecast to sit in the market, so I focused the rebrand on showing them as competent market leaders; highly experienced but dynamic, exciting and constantly evolving with new technologies. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">The typography, colours and image treatment all play a big role in creating the feeling of technological expertise, and cutting edge innovation. The logo itself is representative of speed. Speed to react to market change, speed to support clients maintain quality, and speed for an efficient service for the client. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">As part of the rebrand I created a brand guidelines document to help the team create materials that communicated the brand, and strengthened its standing in the market. </p>
