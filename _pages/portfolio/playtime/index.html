  <p class="text--lg">In a collaboration project, we were asked to create a poster for a special screening event in tribute to Playtime by Jacques Tati.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">We used a style that was playful and exciting, showing the feeling of being lost and made to feel small and insignificant in a big city. The graphical elements reflect plot points from the film, things like the icon, the landmarks of France and the hero with his pipe. </p>
