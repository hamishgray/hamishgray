  <p class="text--lg">Treshna Enterprises required a redesign of their website to portray them as a modern, innovative and exciting local company.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">It was important the website communicate clearly the business services and goals so that a visitor knows exactly what Treshna does the moment they arrive. A short company story was also placed front and centre. By understanding the target audience we knew the importance of a local team with history and commitment to quality. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">The design was successful through its use of bold typography, vivid imagery, and designing with a clear purpose and audience in mind.</p>
