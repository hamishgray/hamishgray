  <p class="text--lg">The brief was to lift the renowned Line 7 brand from obscurity; and into the digital age with a new web experience. Although known for a singular sub-brand; the parent company wanted to bring their entire brand family to the world; and share their myriad collection of products; market versatility and product engineering expertise.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">The elegant, modern web experience was created to give all the brands of Line 7 a platform of exposure and engagement. The design was born from a spirit of technical aesthetic, much like the Line 7 product collection. The web experience functions with precision and efficiency; our primary objective was to deliver a swift, rich user experience; and bring Line 7 into the digital age.</p>
