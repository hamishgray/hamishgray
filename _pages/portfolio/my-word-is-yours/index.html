  <p class="text--lg">The project goal was to take a Maori writing, and working directly with the author create two typographic artworks which resonated with the story.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">The author wrote the following to describe the writing and help guide my design:</p>
  <p class="text--lg">"As adults, we live in a modern world of cumbersome obligations and responsibilities that simply have us exist in, rather than allow ourselves to experience our environment.  We lose sight of the fact that our first responsibility is the protection of this environment for future generations.  We allow ourselves to be weighted with our perception of success and failure that we forget the delight of discovery and from our environment.  </p>
  <p class="text--lg">"The simple, innocent view of the world that is experienced by the child - a world that has seen physical, cultural and spiritual elements eroded.  The traditional narratives I grew up with, became myths and legends to having no meaning or relevance in the context of the 'modern' world ... But with my learning of te reo, I have gone back to my childhood and those narratives to discover that their context and relevance were of significance in the world that existed then.  And with this discovery I am able to experience again the environment that I am in, with my renewed perspective.  </p>
