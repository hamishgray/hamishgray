  <p class="text--lg">DIGMYIDEA is the Māori Innovation Challenge, and presented people with a chance to submit a digital business idea that has the potential to go global.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">The brief was to create a website that communicates technological, digital innovation, and combines this with traditional Māori iconography.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">With the projects logo developed, I expanded on those ideas by creating a repeating graphical pattern of kowhaiwhai, and opting for a gradual colour change as the user scrolls. With these simple effects I was able to make the site feel  cutting-edge and fresh, but still hold onto some Maori influence through subtle patterns.</p>
