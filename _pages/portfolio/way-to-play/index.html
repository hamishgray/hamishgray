  <p class="text--lg">Way to Play is a one-day introduction to playing with children on the Autism Spectrum.</p>
  <p class="text--lg">Playing with a child with autism can be challenging, so the Way to Play workshop offers simple, easy to use strategies to begin playing joyously together. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">The Way to Play website was created to be a supplementary tool for parents and caregivers after completing the one-day workshop. Parents and caregivers are able to engage with a community of like-minded people to share experiences, and get support and advice from peers. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">As part of the website, users are also able to contact the coaches directly with questions, and upload videos showing their efforts for more targeted help with their problems. This tool is invaluable for parents who have so often felt like they are on their own, and on a bad day have no one to turn to for support. </p>
